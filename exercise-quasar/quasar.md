# Exercise: Quasar
**Date:** 18/08/2020

There are 2 x log files. The logs are in the following zip file:

+ [Quasar Intrusion Logs](https://github.com/hostintrusion/scenarios/blob/master/2020-08-Quasar.zip)

During routine maintenance on host DC-1 IPv4 192.168.112\[.\]140, an observant system administrated spotted an unrecognised folder on C: drive. Further analysis of the folder and its content, revealed the following.



The activity (folder creation) occurred out of hours, and quick analysis of the events has determined that doesnâ€™t appear to be a legitimate action. It is suspected that there is a compromise.

## Objective
Using the log files can you determine and undertake the following:

+ What was the name of the malicious document?
+ What was the name of the malware?
+ What is the temporary file name?
+ Where does the malware persist?
+ What is the MD5 hash for the malware (binary)?
+ How does the malware automatically start?
+ What IPv4 address and port does the malware connect to? 
+ What domains are contacted?
+ What commands are invoked by the attacker on DC2 host?
+ What is the name of the file created on DC-2?
+ What did the attacker use the file created on DC-2 for?
+ What commands are invoked by the attacker on DC1 host?
+ What was the purpose of invoking the process starting with 'v'?
+ What was the adversary IP address used to connect via FTP?
+ What folder was used for staging?
+ List the MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
+ Produce a timeline of the events
+ Document any limitations or gaps or issues
+ Document any attacker mistakes
