# Introduction
HostIntrusion.com is an educational resource primarily focused on developing skills and knowledge of host based intrusions. These intrusions have been inspired by real-life documented OSINT reports.

Intended audience: SOC analysts, researchers and network defenders - to detect adversary attacks against enterprise IT systems.

**Prerequisites:** Essential: host and network topologies, infrastructure components/configurations. Basic understanding of Windows and Linux OS, familiarisation of log sources, and knowledge of attack methods is recommended. 

**License:** GNU General Public License v3

**Disclaimer:** Please handle artifacts with care, and do not use on production systems. Whilst care has been taken to minimise use of malicious artifacts, there could be traces i.e. commands/scripts embedded in logs etc.
